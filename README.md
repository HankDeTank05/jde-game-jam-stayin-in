# jde game jam stayin in
 the repository for my JDE Stayin' In game jam game
 
## idea: swingset with friends
- like kirby goal game?
- swing and jump at the right moment to jump the highest/farthest?
- two swingsets facing each other, and if you jump at the same time, high-five midair?

## progression: find your friends
- two friends are lost in a big city and have to find each other (I'm thinking spider-people, swinging. maybe grappling hook because copyright)
- make it a three-player game: one person has the world map, but can't see the locations of the other players. the two players have only a map view of whats immediately around them and have to communicate with the map person to find each other. the map person will help both players
- flip it on its head: one player is lost. all they can see are their surroundings. the other two players start at random locations on the map and have to find the lost player by communicating their surroundings.

## keep it simple: two friends need to find each other in a big area using communication and teamwork
- big maze. two players. each player has a buzzsaw that the other has control over. you have to find each other at a random, specified point in the map. use the buzzsaw to cut down walls, but your battery is limited.
