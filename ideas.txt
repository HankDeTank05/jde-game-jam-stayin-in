ideas:
    for the puzzle game:
        shared sawblade ammo
        intermediary objectives...
            stand on a switch
            hold an item
            pull a lever
            etc.

    for spin-off versions:
        competitive multiplayer (2-4 players, last man standing. kill each other with sawblades/run away)
